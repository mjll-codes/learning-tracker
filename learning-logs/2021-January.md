## Daily Logs

### Tuesday, January 12, 2021
- Created a GitHub Account
  - Watched [Learn Git in 15 minutes by Colt Steele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE)
  - Watched [Learn GitHub in 20 minutes by Colt Steele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhNq2kIvi9s)
  - Read the GitHub introduction manual
- I double-checked I still had Atom and Terminal and my rudimentary understanding of those programs hasn't been lost.

### Wednesday, January 13, 2021
- Began session 1 of Automate the Boring Stuff (ABS)
  - I veered away from using IDLE as I felt it didn't apply anywhere out of python. As I have previously worked with terminal and atom I opted to use these programs.
  - I ended up needing to Google and spot fix opening and running my python script in terminal. Using CD, quit(), etc.
  - Completing the section with the creation of a simile Hello.py program; not dissimilar to the one I wrote in 2019.
  - Explored HackTheBox and the process behind hacking the invite wall (decoding, using the console to search for MakeTheInvite, then googling reqbin decoder, then 64bit decoder, to find the 4x4x4x4 code.)

### Thursday, January 14, 2021
- Downloaded Git and Homebrew
  - Homebrew needed updated through terminal.
  - Made notes of various Git commands for future use and got additional info for command line
- Fully completed the initial changes and set-up on GitHub for my learning tracker.
  - Learnt about archiving and deleting repos
  - Downloading master zips of repos before deleting
  - Troubleshot URL links between files
  - Learnt how to create folders, change the view (using .md at the end of a file) and other formatting tweaks.
  - Set up SSH key on Git to avoid log in when using Git prompt on command line
  - Learnt that .md stands for MarkDown - which is a mark up language. The reason this page looks so pretty!
