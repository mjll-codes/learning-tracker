### Wednesday, January 13, 2021
- Began session 1 of Automate the Boring Stuff (ABS)
  - I veered away from using IDLE as I felt it didn't apply anywhere out of python. As I have previously worked with terminal and atom I opted to use these programs.
  - I ended up needing to Google and spot fix opening and running my python script in terminal. Using CD, quit(), etc.
  - Completeing the section with the creation of a simile Hello.py program; not dissimilar to the one I wrote in 2019.
