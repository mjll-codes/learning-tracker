## Daily Logs

### Monday, May 2, 2022
  - Started The C Programming Language (2nd) by Brian W. Kernighan & Dennis M Ritchie
  - Updated Git and added new pages, etc

  - Notes:
    - Started reading the book, realised I had forgotten what I needed to practice coding off the codecamp website - founds some online IDE's for C that allow me to play around. [Currently using this.](https://www.onlinegdb.com/)

6.3-5 | I wasn't sure how useful this seciton was as it looked like command for a terminal. As I'm using an IDE, I don't think it would be relevant?

  ### Tuesday, May 3, 2022
  - Continued reading The C Programming Language (2nd) by Brian W. Kernighan & Dennis M Ritchie (pages 8 - 13)
  - Updated Git

  - Notes:
    - Completed exercises 1-1, 1-2, [1-3,](https://github.com/mjll-codes/learning-tracker/blob/136922de35687d905fe56c6c9419933765b9b709/learning-outcomes/FtoC.c) [1-4,](https://github.com/mjll-codes/learning-tracker/blob/6ade9839a75b659fb0d77a1d536b157fe6f2da79/learning-outcomes/CtoF.c)

11.1 | I saw this "%d\t%d\n" and had never seen the percentage symbol used in a string before. Upon reading that paragraph I was initially confused as I wasn't sure what they were referring to, but I beleive %d = the first agrement in the print function, then if used again will refer to the next, and so on. So in this function we have -  printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celcius); - which is print, function, string, then 2 arguments (fahr and celcius). So this expands out to printf("fahr, tab, calcius, new line"). That was a fun problem solving moment for me, though minor to others no doubt. The pages goes on to discuss how they must match up propertly by number and type - I'm not sure what this means, does the 'd' denote the type? Turns out, d = int, f = float. So I was right - another feel good moment. 

This tempreture conversion code was an interesting exercise. I learnt a lot about the above, as well as, the below notes:

<pre><code> # include <stdio.h>

/* print Fahrenheit-Celcius mutable
    for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */

main ()

{

float fahr, celcius;
int lower, upper, step;

lower = 0;  /*lower limit of the tempreture table */
upper = 300; /* upper limit */
step = 20; /* step size */

fahr = lower;
while (fahr <= upper) {
    celcius = (5.0 / 9.0) * (fahr-32.0);
    printf("%3.0f %6.1f\n", fahr, celcius); /* the % = arguement, 3 = character width, .0 = decimal places */
    fahr = fahr + step;
}

}
</pre></code>
    
 I managed to do the reverse code for C to F on my own! All I needed was the C to F equation and I imput the rest (exercise 1-4 above). Overall, a good day, feel empowered.

  ### Wednesday, May 4, 2022
  - Continued reading The C Programming Language (2nd) by Brian W. Kernighan & Dennis M Ritchie (pages 13 - 17)
  - Updated Git

  - Notes:
    - Completed exercises [1-5,](https://github.com/mjll-codes/learning-tracker/blob/f14c1f26f456fd0a9f75c1a6f575866e219c2a80/learning-outcomes/300-0.c) [1-6,](https://github.com/mjll-codes/learning-tracker/blob/d702384f69edc5266999fc5cad0dbd46d8006389/learning-outcomes/0or1.c) [1-7](https://github.com/mjll-codes/learning-tracker/blob/7e035a033be34887701eef7fdd4a2757dac637bb/learning-outcomes/EOF.c)

16.5 | Watched [EOF - End of File Explained - C Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7OvYJRb5IQ) to better understand EOF and why they used 'int c' at the beginning. I am still curious why -1 is larger than a character though. 
17.4 | So Exercise 1-6 was a little too vague for me based on the information previously provided. It asked me to verify that the expression getchar() != EOF would be 0 or 1. Despite my accurate attempts to remove the while statements, and add a print function, nothing seemed to work. I checked on YouTube and my code was right but the response from the console wasn't. A little more detailed research later led me to discover I needed to add 'gcc -insert filename-' then run that text through a terminal. I'm not sure if the lapse here was due to insufficient information in the book, my expectation of being walked through step by step or just another moment of being used to using codecamp style exercises where everything was hosted for me and I didn't need to do more.  I am also apprehensive about the program I wrote for exercise 1-7, as it seemed a little too simple. From what I've seen online it does seem to be as simple as it seems.
