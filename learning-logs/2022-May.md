## Daily Logs

### Monday, May 2, 2022
  - Started The C Programming Language (2nd) by Brian W. Kernighan & Dennis M Ritchie
  - Updated Git and added new pages, etc

  - Notes:
    - Started reading the book, realised I had forgotten what I needed to practice coding off the codecamp website - founds some online IDE's for C that allow me to play around.
