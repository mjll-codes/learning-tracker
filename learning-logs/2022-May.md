## Daily Logs

### Monday, May 2, 2022
  - Started The C Programming Language (2nd) by Brian W. Kernighan & Dennis M Ritchie
  - Updated Git and added new pages, etc

  - Notes:
    - Started reading the book, realised I had forgotten what I needed to practice coding off the codecamp website - founds some online IDE's for C that allow me to play around. [Currently using this.](https://www.onlinegdb.com/)

6.3-5 | I wasn't sure how useful this seciton was as it looked like command for a terminal. As I'm using an IDE, I don't think it would be relevant?

 ### Tuesday, May 3, 2022
  - Continued reading The C Programming Language (2nd) by Brian W. Kernighan & Dennis M Ritchie (pages 8 - 13)
  - Updated Git

  - Notes:
    - Completed exercises 1-1, 1-2, [1-3,](https://github.com/mjll-codes/learning-tracker/blob/136922de35687d905fe56c6c9419933765b9b709/learning-outcomes/FtoC.c) [1-4,](https://github.com/mjll-codes/learning-tracker/blob/6ade9839a75b659fb0d77a1d536b157fe6f2da79/learning-outcomes/CtoF.c)

11.1 | I saw this "%d\t%d\n" and had never seen the percentage symbol used in a string before. Upon reading that paragraph I was initially confused as I wasn't sure what they were referring to, but I beleive %d = the first agrement in the print function, then if used again will refer to the next, and so on. So in this function we have -  printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celcius); - which is print, function, string, then 2 arguments (fahr and celcius). So this expands out to printf("fahr, tab, calcius, new line"). That was a fun problem solving moment for me, though minor to others no doubt. The pages goes on to discuss how they must match up propertly by number and type - I'm not sure what this means, does the 'd' denote the type? Turns out, d = int, f = float. So I was right - another feel good moment. 

This tempreture conversion code was an interesting exercise. I learnt a lot about the above, as well as, the below notes:

<pre><code> # include <stdio.h>

/* print Fahrenheit-Celcius mutable
    for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */

main ()

{

float fahr, celcius;
int lower, upper, step;

lower = 0;  /*lower limit of the tempreture table */
upper = 300; /* upper limit */
step = 20; /* step size */

fahr = lower;
while (fahr <= upper) {
    celcius = (5.0 / 9.0) * (fahr-32.0);
    printf("%3.0f %6.1f\n", fahr, celcius); /* the % = arguement, 3 = character width, .0 = decimal places */
    fahr = fahr + step;
}

}
</pre></code>
    
 I managed to do the reverse code for C to F on my own! All I needed was the C to F equation and I imput the rest (exercise 1-4 above). Overall, a good day, feel empowered.
