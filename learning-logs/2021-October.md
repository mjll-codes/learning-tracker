## Daily Logs
  

### Friday, October 1, 2021
<!--  - Continued JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
    - 72% into Basic Javascript
  - When creating the card counting game, I thought my code would also work - though it's hard to tell when the only solution was theirs. They used Switch & Case which I should have guessed and found slightly less intuitive.
    
    
    Subject | Mistake
    --- | ---
    Switch & Case | Used 'console.log()' instead of 'answer =' for result
    Switch & Case | Missed the 'break' statement after case & answer
    Switch & Case | Minor typos, missing close brace, etc
    Switch & Case | Used a semicolon after a 'case' statement instead of a colon
    Boolean values | Misread the sample data
    Boolean values | 'Undefined' doesn't go in a string; didn't use the 'II' function attempted to streamline with 'abTest < 0' instead of 'a < 0 II b < 0'; forgot to use curly braces to open 'if' statement
    Card Counting Project | Got the format totally wrong, this was [my solution](https://github.com/mjll-codes/learning-tracker/tree/main/learning-outcomes/cc.js)
