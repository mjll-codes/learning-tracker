## Daily Logs
  

### Friday, October 1, 2021
- Continued JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
    - 89% into Basic Javascript
- I'm feeling a little lost around what to call things, like, what reference do you use for sub markers like 'case', 'break', etc. Or is this something I will pick up slowly?
- Is there not an easier way to get this result, I know this is an example, but I'd like to see an example where using this style of code would be the best option:

    <pre><code>  var dogs = {
    Fido: "Mutt",  Hunter: "Doberman",  Snoopie: "Beagle"
    };
    var myDog = "Hunter";
    var myBreed = dogs[myDog];
    Console.log(myBreed); </pre></code>

- When completing another assignment, I don't understand the difference between my code and their solution code, when bracket and dot notations are supposed to be interchangeable. See [my code v solution code here](https://github.com/mjll-codes/learning-tracker/tree/main/learning-outcomes/records.js).
- Mistake tracker:
    
    Subject | Mistake
    --- | ---
    Object| Typos, used the assigned value instead of the property name to access the property using dot notation. When
    Object| Lookup: When used for look up, i didn't know to enter "result = lookup[val];" at the end - I misinterpreted these instructions "Use it to look up val and assign the associated string to the result variable."
    Object| Checking for properties: When creating an object that checks for properties, I found that the example they provided didn't translate well into the answer they wanted and that caused various errors. I googled a little then watched the explanation video, where it finally made sense. 
    Object| Arrays within objects: minor errors only, forgetting commas, etc
    Loops| While loops: minor typos
    Loops| For loops: forgot 'for' curly braces; used commas instead of semicolons to separate the expressions inside the 'for' loop; minor typos;
    Loops| For loops through an array: Another one where they asked us to write a type of code they've not shown us before. Errors for me were using () instead of [] in the below.
    Loops| Multiply multi-dimensional arrays: This one I did well, only made the error of using the 'multipleAll' name instead of the assigned 'arr' - very frustrating to find that as the error, but happy that i did so much of the rest right.
     
 For loops through an array code:
 
    var myArr = [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    var total = 0; // I didn't do this either, I used total instead of 'i' in the next line.
    for (var i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++) { // I did all these the same, just with total.
    total += myArr[i]; // Didn't know how to close with this, as we hadn't been shown that yet.
    }
    console.log(total); // I still don't know what console.log is all about, but they use it often.
