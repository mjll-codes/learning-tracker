## Daily Logs
  

### Friday, October 1, 2021
- Continued JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
    - 72% into Basic Javascript
- I'm feeling a little lost around what to call things, like, what reference do you use for sub markers like 'case', 'break', etc. Or is this something I will pick up slowly?
- Is there not an easier way to get this result, I know this is an example, but I'd like to see an example where using this style of code would be the best option:

>var dogs = {
>  Fido: "Mutt",  Hunter: "Doberman",  Snoopie: "Beagle"
>};
>var myDog = "Hunter";
>var myBreed = dogs[myDog];
>console.log(myBreed);

- When completing another assignment, I don't understand the difference between my code and their solution code, when bracket and dot notations are supposed ot be interchangable. See [my code v solution code here](https://github.com/mjll-codes/learning-tracker/tree/main/learning-outcomes/records.js)
- Mistake tracker:
    
    Subject | Mistake
    --- | ---
    Object| Typos, used the assigned value instead of the property name to access the property using dot notation. When
    Object| Lookup: When used for look up, i didn't know to enter "result = lookup[val];" at the end - I misinterpreted these instructions "Use it to look up val and assign the associated string to the result variable."
    Object| Checking for properties: When creating an object that checks for properties, I found that the example they provided didn't translate well into the answer they wanted and that caused various errors. I googled a little then watched the explanation video, where it finally made sense. 
    Object| Arrays within objects: minor errors only, forgetting commas, etc
