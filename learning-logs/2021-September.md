### Monday, September 27, 2021
  - Using w3schools CSS modules I was able to research and correct the styling issues from yesterday - see Personal Portfolio Page. 
  - I feel as if I have a better handle on CSS and how the styling wokrs together. My confidence is minimal but I feel like with more practice I will get there.
  - Work was very busy this afternoon leaving me less time to spend on this than I'd like. 
    
  TODAYS HOURS:  1 hour
  
### Tuesday, September 28, 2021
  - Started JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
    - 40% into Basic Javascript
    
  TODAYS HOURS:   1hour 1 mins
  
### Wednesday, September 29, 2021
  - Continued JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
    - 66% into Basic Javascript
    - The exercises are getting harder and are similar to Python. Data structures aren't unfamiliar so that is helping.
    - Made small mistakes when creating if else lists, like using assignment =, instead of comparative ==; took me way too long to figure it out.
    
  TODAYS HOURS:   1 hour  41 mins

### Thursday, September 30, 2021
  - Continued JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
    - 72% into Basic Javascript
  - When creating the card counting game, I thought my code would also work - though it's hard to tell when the only solution was theirs. They used Switch & Case which I should have guessed and found slightly less intuitive.
    
    
    Subject | Mistake
    --- | ---
    Switch & Case | Used 'console.log()' instead of 'answer =' for result
    Switch & Case | Missed the 'break' statement after case & answer
    Switch & Case | Minor typos, missing close brace, etc
    Switch & Case | Used a semicolon after a 'case' statement instead of a colon
    Boolean values | Misread the sample data
    Boolean values | 'Undefined' doesn't go in a string; didn't use the 'II' function attempted to streamline with 'abTest < 0' instead of 'a < 0 II b < 0'; forgot to use curly braces to open 'if' statement
    Card Counting Project | Got the format totally wrong, this was [my solution](https://github.com/mjll-codes/learning-tracker/tree/main/learning-outcomes/cc.js)
    
    
    
 
 TODAYS HOURS:   1 hour  26 mins
