    - Completed task 1-8 after speaking with TL, he pointed out some obvious references and proper braces placement. I needed to place the print function outside the while braces to acheive the visual output I wanted.

Ex 1-9 | I struggled with exercise 1-9 as it was asking me to "Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank" - I went back and read through the previous pages and could find no reference to this process. I went to stackoverflow for help, they went through the theory on how the machine processes this function and provided answers for it, though it was frustrating as I couldn't find any reference to how to know that in the previous pages of the book.
